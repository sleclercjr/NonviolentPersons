		<h2 class="contName">Moscow Olympics</h2>
		<p class="cont">
			he 1980 Olympics were held in Moscow, Russia. The Soviet Union, officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was still the head of the 
			government and in control of Russia in the 1980’s. Leonid Brezhnev was the leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at this time (Britannica, 2018). 
			Brezhnev and the Soviet Union made the decision to invade Afghanistan in 1979, which would greatly affect the Olympics of 1980.

			In 1978, communism made its way to Afghanistan and as a result the communist party took power. Nur Mohammad Taraki was chosen to be the president of the communist 
			party (Soviet Tanks Roll into Afghanistan). It did not take long for anti-communism groups to form. As a result, in 1979, only a year after the communist party 
			took over Afghanistan, most of the country was in open rebellion to the government. Nur Mohammad Taraki was assassinated by the anti-communist people of 
			Afghanistan and the communist relations with the Soviet Union were also deteriorated (Soviet Tanks Roll into Afghanistan). Brezhnev feared that an 
			anti-communist party would take Afghanistan over again. On December 24th, 1979 Brezhnev and the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan (Britannica, 2018).

		<p class="cont">
			10 days after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, representatives from NATO met and discussed boycotting the 1980 Olympics (The Olympic Boycott). But, not 
			many representatives were interested in participating, this was until Andrei Sakharov called for a boycott. Sakharov was a Russian nuclear physicist and known 
			worldwide for his activism in peace (Nobel Media, 2014). This surprised many countries because Sakharov wanted to boycott the Olympics that were held in his 
			country. United States President Jimmy Carter joined Sakharov’s stand and issued a statement saying if the Soviet Union did not withdraw their troops by 
			February 19th, 1980 than the United States would boycott the Olympics held in Moscow. The Soviet Union did not withdraw its troops and on March 21st, 1980 
			President Jimmy Carter officially announced the United States would boycott the Olympic games (The Olympic Boycott).

		<h4 class="contName">A newspaper heading shows how committed President Carter was to boycott the Olympics</h4>

		<p class="cont">
			In Jimmy Carter’s State of the Union Address delivered in 1980 he discussed why the United States will not be sending an Olympic team to Moscow. President 
			Carter discusses the Soviet Unions invasion of Afghanistan as “radical” and “aggressive” because they are using their great military power against a deeply 
			religious and defenseless nation (Peters, 2018). President Carter could have easily declared war against the Soviet Union for invading Afghanistan. One because 
			the Soviet Union is attempting to spread communism, and two because Afghanistan is of great strategic importance. Afghanistan exports two thirds of the world's 
			oil, and if the Soviet Union took over Afghanistan than it would have given the Soviet Union great advantage over other enemy countries like the United States. 
			But, President Carter knew that the world would have gone into another world war if he declared war on the Soviet Union. In the State of the Union Address he 
			speaks numerous times about wanting to maintain peace in the world. “I'm determined that the United States will remain the strongest of all nations, but our 
			power will never be used to initiate a threat to the security of any nation or to the rights of any human being. We seek to be and to remain secure—a nation 
			at peace in a stable world.” (Peters, 2018)
		</p>
		<p class="cont">
			President Carter stayed true to his word about maintaining peace in a stable world. He attacked the Soviet Union in nonviolent ways. The non-violent ways 
			included prohibiting the Soviet Union to fish in coastal water of the United States, cutting the Soviets access to high-technology equipment and agricultural 
			products (The Olympic Boycott). Lastly, he prohibited the United States to participate in the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Boycotting the Moscow Olympics was President 
			Jimmy Carter's most creative and most well known non-violent act against the Soviet Union.
		</p>
		<p class="cont">
			When Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would boycott the Olympics he invited other nations to join in on the boycott. By the time the Olympic games 
			started only 80 nations were participating, this is still the fewest amount of countries to participate in any given Olympics (The Olympic Boycott). 
			66 nations boycotted, including countries that had a large presence in the world such as China, West Germany and Japan. The Soviet Union was hoping to 
			use the Olympics as a political campaign to improve not only their image but also communism’s image (Dyslin, 2016). But, a third or the expected 
			foreign visitors stayed away because of the boycott. The struggling economy of the Soviet Union needed the revenue that the Olympic games would bring 
			in, but that money never came. 
		</p>
		<p class="cont">
			Jimmy Carter boycotting the Olympics in Moscow was a creative non-violent protest against the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. Boycotting the Olympics 
			was creative and an efficient protest for several reasons. The Olympics are one of the most popular sporting events in the world, so boycotting an event that 
			the world can see will make more people knowledgeable about the issues with the Soviet Union. Secondly, Olympics produce revenue for the country that hosts 
			them and the country that hosts them can display their image. The Soviet Union did not have substantial revenue and were not able to express communism to the 
			outside world, this was all due to the boycott. Perhaps the Soviet Union would not have dissolved in 1991 if the United States did not boycott the 1980 Olympics. 
			Boycotting the Olympics was a successful non-violent protest in sports history and shows that disputes can be settled in nonviolent ways if thought is put into it.
