			Muhammad Ali is arguably the most important and well-known sports figure in history. People around the world know him for being one of the greatest 
			boxers of all time. Muhammad Ali had an impressive 56 wins and only 5 losses, he was a three-time World Heavyweight Champion and an Olympic gold 
			medalist (Collective, 2015). He became a celebrity because of his success in the ring. Ali used his celebrity status to protest the Vietnam War 
			and African Americans Civil Rights. Not many famous athletes were willing to protest an issue that might risk ending their career. Bill Russell, 
			a Hall of Fame center that played in the NBA, said this about Muhammad Ali when he refused the military draft, “I envy Muhammad Ali, he has 
			something I have never been able to attain and something very few people possess”. Jim Brown, a famous NFL running back also said this “It was 
			unbelievable, the courage he had. He wasn’t just a champion athlete. He was a champion who fought for his people” (Zirin, 2016, June 4th). 
			Muhammad Ali saw that the “black world” needed help, he knew he would lose his career, but protesting was “more important than money” (Betancourt, 2017).

			The Vietnam War was a war that people in the United States saw as unfair and meaningless. Men were dying quickly due to Guerilla Warfare. 
			As a result, the United States started drafting men and sending them to fight with nearly no military training. Protests started to break 
			out all over the United States. Muhammad Ali was one of those protesters. Muhammad Ali was drafted to the United States Army in 1967 but 
			refused to join (Muhammad Ali, 2018). When asked about his refusal to be drafted he said this “Why should they ask me to put on a uniform 
			and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated 
			like dogs and denied simple human rights?” (Zirin, 2016, June 4th). The United States government would try and make Muhammad Ali pay for 
			his refusal. He was striped of his World Heavyweight titles, banned from boxing, and was sentenced to five-years in prison. Ali did not 
			serve any time in prison, eventually got his World Heavyweight titles back, but did miss three of his prime years in boxing “(Collective, 2015). 
			During the years where he was prohibited to box, he used his platform to publicly speak about the racial inequalities. Muhammad Ali and 
			Martin Luther King Jr. became close friends and often spoke together at rallies. Similar to what famous athletes of the time said about Ali, 
			Martin Luther King Jr. said this “No matter what you think about Mr. Muhammad Ali, you certainly have to admire his courage” (Betancourt, 2017). 
			Muhammad Ali’s courage and commitment to non-violence inspired people around the world to protest the Vietnam War and civil right inequalities in 
			the United States.

			Muhammad Ali was the first athlete to use his platform to protest issues in the world. Numerous athletes have since followed in his footsteps. 
			John Carlos and Tommie Smith were American sprinters that competed in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. During the medal ceremony they raised their 
			fists as a sign of “black power”. They said Muhammad Ali inspired them and he was “the warrior-saint of the Black Athletes Revolt” (Zirin, 2016, June 6th). 
			Billie Jean King was a women’s tennis player that was trying to get equal rights for women in sports. Muhammad Ali supported her and often said the phrase 
			“Billie Jean King, you are the queen!” (Zirin, 2016, June 6th). She admired Ali and said that he made her have confidence when speaking to large crowds. 
			Colin Kaepernick has been the latest athlete to use his platform to protest black oppression in the United States. Kaepernick kneeled during the national 
			anthem before his NFL games.

			Muhammad Ali is a sports icon around the world for not only being one of the greatest boxers of all time but also being and activist for his people. 
			He used creative non-violent ways to inspire change in America. His ways will forever be remembered and will be used as a template for athletes that 
			want to protest in the future.
