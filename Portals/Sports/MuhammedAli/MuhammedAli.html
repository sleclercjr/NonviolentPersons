            Muhammad Ali is most commonly known for being one of the greatest boxers in history. He also played a major role as an activist in 
            the African American civil rights movement and protesting the Vietnam War. Ali was one of the first major sports figures to risk 
            losing his career to protest issues in the United States. Cassius Clay was Aliâ€™s birthname, but in 1964 he changed it to Muhammad 
            Ali. There were several reasons for this including joining the Nation of Islam because they are inclusive of everyone regardless of 
            race. He also explained that Cassius Clay was the name of a white slave master. In 1966, amidst the Vietnam war, Muhammad Ali 
            refused to be drafted into the United States military. Along with refusing to be drafted, he spoke publicly protesting the Vietnam 
            War and African American Civil Rights. As a result, he was stripped of his world heavyweight boxing title and banned from boxing for 
            three years, he got banned during the prime of his career. Muhammad Ali often protested with Malcom X and with their help the Civil 
            Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act were passed. Muhammad Ali inspired change in the United States through his non-violent protests.
