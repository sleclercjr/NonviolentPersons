			<p>Born in 1950, Debbie Allen’s career began to take off in 1980 when she starred in the Broadway presentation of West Side Story, earning a Tony nomination. Since this time, Debbie has appeared on many TV shows including In the House and Grey’s Anatomy. Debbie opened her famous dance studio, Debbie Allen Dance Academy, in Los Angeles in 2001.  
				Debbie’s early life wasn’t so glamorous. As a child, she began dancing at the age of 3 and was determined to make it big as a professional performer. Debbie grew up during a difficult, racist, and segregated time. In an interview with the Washington Post, she recalls “I grew up not being able to go to the movie theater downtown; I grew up not being able to go to the amusement park, except one day a year; I grew up in a school system that was totally segregated. (Allen, Debbie 1950-, 2018). She also recalls being a victim of discrimination when being turned away from eating at a local restaurant (Fulwood, 2016). To address this problem, Debbie’s mother moved the family to Mexico when Debbie was still a child. Two years later, when the family returned to the United States, Debbie Allen was turned down from a dance studio due to her race at only 12 years old. At 16, Debbie was rejected from the North Carolina School of the Arts for the same reason. Throughout her personal and professional career, racism and discrimination has been no stranger to Debbie. 
				Debbie Allen is the writer, director, and choreographer of the production Freeze Frame. This show premiered in Australia in 2013 and was later performed in Washington D.C. The piece is described as being “inspired by real-life incidents, the dance theatre piece examines race relations in America”(Viagas, 2016). To address the current problems in our world, Debbie created this piece to display police brutality, discrimination against black men, issues with gun violence, and more. </p><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&v=0H5dbcyIjr0">Click here</a><p> to hear Debbie talk about the production herself. </p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV2nT9e5SgA">Click here</a><p> to view one of songs from the production.</p>
