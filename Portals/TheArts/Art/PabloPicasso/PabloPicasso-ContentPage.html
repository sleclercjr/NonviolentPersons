			<p>A revolutionary painter of Spanish origin, Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), turned the world on its ear with his art. He garnered clout in the artistic community and captured the interest of the general population at large by continually changing his style and techniques. As he matured, he began to express and reflect more and more of what spoke to him in the world around him. His paintings touch upon war, prostitution, and communist politics among other harsh realities while begging for peace.<br><br>
				Prior to fame and career accolades like two-time International Lenin Peace Prize winner, Pablo was a creativity-gifted youth who struggled academically at various art schools in Spain. Sketching and drawing what he saw around him in the gutters of the city, capturing the likeness of criminals, panhandlers, prostitutes, and his own crippling depression alike consumed his adolescence. The preferred subjects for his paintings go hand in hand with ongoing social change issues of his time.<br><br>
				In 1937 Picasso completed the famous ‘Guernica’ in reaction to the horrors of World War II and the bombings of the Basque town of the same name. This painting is world renowned for spurring discussion on the violence and innate tragedies of war. </p><a href="https://documentaryvine.com/video/simon-schamas-power-of-art/?tape=7">Click here</a><p> In this video a British historian documents the impact of Picasso’s bombing piece. <br><br>
				Picasso died at the age of 91 and is remembered for his innovative approach to beautifully conceptualizing the cumbersome and traditionally ugly aspects of human existence; violence, depression, poverty, and vice.
