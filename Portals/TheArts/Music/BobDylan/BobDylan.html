                Born in 1941 in Minnesota, Bob Dylan grew up to be one of the most influential American rock and roll musicians. Bob Dylan is 
                well known for personalizing folk songs and performing his own original poetic songs. His second album, “The Freewheelin’ Bob 
                Dylan”, released in 1963, previewed the young adult’s interest in politics and the Civil Rights movement. By 1964 Dylan was on 
                tour playing an average of 200 concerts a year which included many of his protest songs such as “Blowin’ in The Wind”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Dylan’s 
                girlfriend, Suze Rotolo, has a great influence on him becoming an activist singer and encouraged him to perform at political 
                rallies. Dylan spent the year of 1962 performing at benefits in New York with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee 
                (SNCC).  Bob Dylan, now extremely well known, spent time performing for causes such as the Freedom March in D.C. before leaving 
                the activist scene to focus on his rock and roll music<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.
