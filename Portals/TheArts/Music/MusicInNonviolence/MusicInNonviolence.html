		<p class="cont">
            On March 11, 1962 Bob Dylan performed his song “The Death of Emmett Till” on a radio program. 
            The lyrics of the song tell the story of the young boy, Emmett Till, who suffered a a violent killing for supposedly 
            whistling at a white woman. The two men were acquitted and Bob Dylan, along with many others, were inspired to vocalize 
            the story. Bob Dylan and Emmett Till were born within months of each other which could have heightened Dylan’s interest in the case.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

        <p class="cont">
            John Lennon released his single “Give Peace a Chance” in 1969 which quickly became the anthem of the anti-war movement among 
            Americans who disapproved of the current war in Vietnam at the time. The song was written during a “Bed-In” in which Lennon 
            and his wife, Yoko Ono, spend 8 days to promote world peace. On October 15, 1969, the famous Moratorium to End the War in 
            Vietnam took place which included protesters singing this song.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>

        <h3 class="contName">"Say Something" - Justin Timberlake ft. Chris Stapleton</h3>

        <p class="cont"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MPbR6Cbwi4">Say Something</a></p>
        <p class="cont">
            “Say Something” may seem like a stereotypical 2018 pop-song, but Justin Timberlake and Chris Stapleton have shared that there is a 
            greater meaning behind it. The two famous singers explain how the lyrics of the song represent how as celebrities, they are often 
            asked to comment on current troubling issues. The lyrics state how the two wish they could do this, but that it is not always so 
            easy. The two write about the pressure to “say something” and their desire to be rid of this responsibility and expectation.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
            This is an example of nonviolent protesting; resisting the pressure to comment on troubling issues.

        <p class="cont">
            U2 uses his fame and celebrity status to speak about AIDS and donates all of the proceeds of the song “One” to AIDS research 
            as a benefit single. U2 is helping “fight” AIDS and create social change in a positive way.

        <p class="cont">
            “Alyssa Lies” tells the story of a little girl who hides her bruises that she received from being abused at home. One day, 
            one of her friends tells her dad and Alyssa doesn’t show up to school the next day because her abuse had finally lead to death. 
            Jason Michael Carroll describes writing this song as a spiritual experience. The purpose of the song is to spread awareness of 
            the issue of child abuse.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>

        <p class="cont">

        <h3 class="contName">"Flawless" - Beyonce</h3>

        <p class="cont"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyuUWOnS9BY">Flawless</a></p>
        <p class="cont">
            Beyoncé chose to include excerpts of a TED Talk on women’s’ rights by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. This bold move of placing 
            the excerpt in the middle of her song forces listeners to pay attention and hear the message. Beyoncé makes the point that 
            it is possible to be a feminist and sexy at the same time.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>

            “I Have a Dream” speech. The lyrics of the song show the artist’s distinct feelings against the destructive forces of hate, 
            ignorance, violence, greed, etc.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>

        <p class="cont">
            This song by Billie Holiday is described as a “haunting protest against the inhumanity of racism”. The lyrics of the song come 
            from a piece of writing that was inspired by a photograph of a lynching. The writer of this piece is Abel Meeropol, a man from 
            New York City. Meeropol attended high school in the Bronx and graduated from Dewitt Clinton in 1921. He then went on to teach 
            English for 17 years. Meeropol is known as being a poet and social activist who was upset about the continuation of racism in 
            the 1930’s which lead him to write the poem that later became this song.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>

        <p class="cont"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l4nVByCL44">Blowin' in the Wind</a></p>
        <p class="cont">
            This song by Bob Dylan is universal in the sense that it can be applied to almost any issue of freedom. The song is seen as 
            controversial due to the fact that the Pope was “uncomfortable” with Bob Dylan performing the song in church settings even 
            though the churches were using the song for liberal crowd hymns. The song quickly became an anthem of the civil rights movement. 
            Dylan sang the song at a voter registration rally in Mississippi and others sang the song on other important days such as the day 
            Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. The powerful lyrics of the song references anti-war movements.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>
