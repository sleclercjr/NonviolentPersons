        <h3 class="contName">"The Death of Emmitt Till" - Bob Dylan</h3>
		<p class="cont">
            On March 11, 1962 Bob Dylan performed his song “The Death of Emmett Till” on a radio program. 
            The lyrics of the song tell the story of the young boy, Emmett Till, who suffered a a violent killing for supposedly 
            whistling at a white woman. The two men were acquitted and Bob Dylan, along with many others, were inspired to vocalize 
            the story. Bob Dylan and Emmett Till were born within months of each other which could have heightened Dylan’s interest in the case.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

        <h3 class="contName">"Give Peace a Chance" - John Lennon</h3>
        <p class="cont">
            John Lennon released his single “Give Peace a Chance” in 1969 which quickly became the anthem of the anti-war movement among 
            Americans who disapproved of the current war in Vietnam at the time. The song was written during a “Bed-In” in which Lennon 
            and his wife, Yoko Ono, spend 8 days to promote world peace. On October 15, 1969, the famous Moratorium to End the War in 
            Vietnam took place which included protesters singing this song.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>

        <h3 class="contName">"Say Something" - Justin Timberlake ft. Chris Stapleton</h3>
        <p class="cont">
            “Say Something” may seem like a stereotypical 2018 pop-song, but Justin Timberlake and Chris Stapleton have shared that there is a 
            greater meaning behind it. The two famous singers explain how the lyrics of the song represent how as celebrities, they are often 
            asked to comment on current troubling issues. The lyrics state how the two wish they could do this, but that it is not always so 
            easy. The two write about the pressure to “say something” and their desire to be rid of this responsibility and expectation.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
            This is an example of nonviolent protesting; resisting the pressure to comment on troubling issues.
