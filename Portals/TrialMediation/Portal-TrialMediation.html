		<p class="introduction">
			Non violence is a term that lacks definition but it is easily recognized simply by what it is not, it is not violence. The law is 
			intended to be an alternative to individual violence, and although the legal system is far from perfect, it is the only 
			available alternative to bloodshed. Those who enter law school do so with the intention of creating a more peaceful society in
			which we live, not to further the violence that exists in the world. Conflict resolution by trial, mediation, and arbitration
			are meant to bring a peaceful end to potentially violent conflicts. Although mediation, arbitration, and trials reach resolution
			differently their similarity lies in their nonviolent characteristic. Similarly to nonviolence, these methods of conflict
			resolution are not passive. They require active understanding of each parties goals and what they hope to accomplish through
			mediation, arbitration, and trials. Individuals engaged in conflict willingly agree to face each other and resolve a 
			conflict in a way that is mutually beneficial, it is not always easy, but requires that we as humans become problem solvers
			and engage in nonviolent behavior when it may not always be the easiest route to take.
