		<h2 class="contName">Mediation</h2>
        <img class="centeredImg" alt="mediation example" src="/NonViolence/images/MediationHeader.jpg">
        
        <p class="cont">
            Mediation by definition, is “a form of alternative dispute resolution which allows individuals involved in a dispute 
            the opportunity to work together towards resolving their own differences”. Mediation is conducted with the guidance 
            of a trained mediator. Mediators serve as neutral parties that help in the dispute resolution process. They are 
            different than arbitrators in that they do not make binding decisions, but instead help to guide conflicting parties 
            to a mutually agreed upon decision. If the process of mediation is not successful, it’s nonbinding nature allows 
            conflicting parties to pursue other options of conflict resolution.

        <h2 class="contName">Benefits of Mediation over Trials</h2>
        <img class="" alt="Venn Diagram" src="/NonViolence/images/MediationVennDiagram.jpg">
        
        <p class="cont">Mediation has many benefits that make it more appealing than traditional trial settings. When comparing 
            the cost of going to trial with the cost of going to mediation the difference is astounding. Mediation costs about 
            $6,000 on average while trials cost an average of $43,000 making trials an average of seven times more expensive 
            than mediation.  Mediation is also confidential, if the mediation does not go as planned and one side decides to 
            bring it to a traditional courtroom nothing that was said during mediation can be brought up while in court. Court 
            records are often made public whereas mediation allows for this to remain confidential to the parties involved.  
            Mediation also allows for each side to state what they are looking to get out of the mediation as opposed to in 
            courtrooms where the judge (or jury) makes the final decision.  This system allows for each side to negotiate with 
            the other in order to determine the real goals each person has and allows each party to work together to reach a 
            collective goal.  This allows for each side to be empowered and have a real part in the decision making as they 
            are the final decision makers, not the mediator.  In trial settings the two parties do everything they can to make 
            a compelling case to the judge who makes the final decision, but in a mediation setting this is not the case; each 
            side is given a chance to respond to the demands of the other and negotiate a reasonable solution they can both get 
            behind. Lastly mediation allows for a much faster timeline than a trial would as the timeline is created by the parties 
            involved and there is no need to wait for a court date to create a solution.</p>
        <img class="centeredImg" alt="Mediation Puzzle" src="/NonViolence/images/MediationPuzzle.jpg"><br/>
        <p class="cont">Compared to trials mediation allows for a much more even playing field.  In the case of trials money matters, 
            when one party has significantly more money than the other they are at a huge advantage.  With more money they will be 
            able to hire better lawyers, hire more lawyers, and be able to devote more time to the trial. With less money it can be 
            harder to get a lawyer that is as good and with a longer trial it can become a financial burden with the legal fees adding 
            up.  In the case of mediation an attorney is not always necessary making it easier for those who are unable to afford one 
            to get an outcome that benefits them. In addition trials are often ‘fights’ that bring up nasty information especially in 
            the case of divorces or separations.  In these cases it is the most beneficial to go the nonviolent route and use a mediator 
            to keep it civil and respectful. There are different types of mediation that are fit for different types of disputes which is 
            touched upon in the next section.

        <h3 class="contName">Types of Mediation</h3>
        <h4 class="contName">Facilative Mediation</h4>
        <p class="cont">This type of mediation allows for the mediator to be directly involved in the discussion, but not in the solution. 
            The mediator’s role here is to help facilitate the conversation by asking questions, making sure each side gets a chance to 
            speak, and assisting in finding and analyzing the options available for a solution. However, the mediator does not give advice, 
            give their own opinion, or make any kind of prediction about what the court might do if they had gone that route.  Most often 
            these types of mediation are held with both parties present during the conversation as opposed to having just the attorney there.
