        <p class="cont">
                Trials by definition, are “the examination before a judicial tribunal of the facts put in issue in a cause, often including 
            issues of law as well as those of fact. Modern day trials are used to determine a person's guilt or innocence by presenting 
            the case to a group of the defendant's peers of various racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic backgrounds. Trials involve individuals 
            such judges, lawyers, prosecutors and juries that are present to ensure a fair trial and that justice is accomplished fairly. 
            Trials have evolved from violent events to those that suppress violence in situations that which extreme violence has occured.<br/>
            While trials were originally intended to create a level playing field for two parties to settle a dispute, that is not always 
            the case. An unequal power dynamic still exists between the conflicting parties when one party has greater access to financial 
            resources, which is typically the case when individuals are challenging a corporation or an individual who has economic power. 
            Individuals or corporations who have access to large amounts of funds are able to hire the best legal team and have access to 
            the best lawyers, they may even have lawyers working for them before the trial even begins. It is because of this inequality 
            that wealthier parties are able to ‘bully’ their opponents in the courtroom. They may not bully them physically but they are 
            able to build a case and legal team that their lesser opponent would never be able to afford, thus creating an imbalance of 
            power within the courtroom.

        <h2 class="cont">History of Trials</h2>
        <p class="cont"><em>“No mal shall be taken, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will we proceed against or prosecute him, 
            except by the lawful judgement of his peers and by the law of the land”<br/>
            -Magna Carta, 1215</em></p>
        
        <p class="cont">The history of trial by jury began in England, when it was introduced and by whom is a topic up for debate, with some 
            historians claiming it was William the Conqueror that influenced the creation of trials, while others point to evidence within the 
            Anglo-Saxons before the Norman conquest. The introduction of jury trials was however a direct result of the banning of Trials by 
            Ordeal by Pope Innocent III within the Magna Carta. The Magna Carta was created in 1215 to protect civil liberties of English subjects 
            and guaranteed them two important aspects of a democratic society, a representative government and trial by jury. In it included a clause 
            that is representative of modern day jury trials, containing ruling about how disputes with the King over land should be handled. These 
            land related disputes were ordered to be settled by men who were of similar rank and status to those who were involved in the dispute with 
            the King, it is an early example of trial by jury and presenting evidence in front of one’s peers to be judged by them. William Blackstone 
            however, considered the Frankish Inquest developed in 829 A.D. to be the start of the modern day jury system. English citizens right to a 
            trial by jury began to break down in the wake of Henry VII and his implementation of the Star Chamber, a method of unfairly trying 
            individuals that was a complete disregard for individuals rights.
        </p>
        <p class="cont">
            The United States Bill of Rights guarantees legal rights through the 6th Amendment. The 6th Amendment explains the right to a speedy, 
            impartial trial in criminal cases. The 7th Amendment secures the right to a jury trial in civil cases. 
        </p>
        <p class="cont">
            There have also been a few other examples of jury trials throughout history, though none as concrete as those in England. Around 2000 B.C., 
            ancient Egyptians handled conflicts through Kenebet, which contained eight jurors, four from each side of the Nile River. In 6th century B.C. 
            in Greece, in Dikastes, elected citizens tried cases and passed judgements on citizens. 
        </p>
        <p class="cont">
            Evidence of juries can be found within all nations that adopted the feudal system such as Germany, France and Italy. Although historians have yet 
            to agree on the origin of trials in England, the current system of trials represents influence brought to England by invaders, such as the Normans.
