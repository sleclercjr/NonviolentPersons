		<h2 class="contName">Septima Poinsette Clark</h2>
		
		<div class="cont">
			<p>Born on May 3 rd , 1898 in Charleston, South Carolina, Septima Clark grew up
as the second oldest of eight children. Her father, a former slave, and her mother
strongly believed in education and pushed Septima to attend school and pursue a
college education. After attending public schools for African American children,
Clark attended the Avery Normal Institute, a private college for colored individuals,
where she obtained degree that would allow her to become an educator. Upon
graduation, Septima faced racial challenges when applying to become an instructor
in Charleston, South Carolina public schools as policies in place at the time forbid
African American educators in the city’s public educational centers. Determined to
teach, Mrs. Clark accepted a job at a public school in Johns Island, South Carolina
after graduating from college. Her time at the John Island school would not only be
the start of her impressive teaching career, but the beginning of her work with the
NAACP.<br><br>
In 1919 Septima returned to teach at her alma mater. With the help of the
NAACP, Clark continued to teach while campaigning and collecting signatures to
petition the city of Charleston, South Carolina to allow African American instructors
to educate students in white and mixed public schools. She was successful in her
petition to the city and further worked to acquire equal pay among the races for
educators. To assist in her challenges, Thurgood Marshal fought alongside Clark in a
1945 court case that would elicit equal pay for educators regardless of race. After
winning this case, Septima’s salary was increased by three times the amount she
had previously been receiving. Clark recalled the case as the ‘first effort in a social
action challenging the status quo”.<br><br>
Clark returned to Charleston In 1947 to continue her teaching career, though
this was unfortunately cut short nine years later when the state of South Carolina
imposed a law in 1956 which prohibited educators to be involved with civil rights
groups. Septima refused to leave the NAACP and as a result, was fired from her
teaching position. While hindering her progress, Clark quickly regained her footing,
moved to Tennessee, and was hired to teach at the Highlander Folk School, where
they supported integration and civil rights. It was during this employment where
Clark utilized school breaks to begin workshops to further her nonviolent civil
rights causes, drawing in many individuals including Rosa Parks. Also during her
time at the Highland Folk School, Septima began directing the Highlanders
Citizenship School Program, which strived to teach people basic literary and
mathematic skills to increase the number of African American eligible to vote during
the time literacy laws that existed in America until 1960. In 1961, the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference took over the project and made Mrs. Clark the
Director of Education and Teaching. Under her direction, the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference opened over 800 citizenship schools until her retirement in
1970. Nine years after her retirement, President Jimmy Carter presented her with
the Living Legacy Award, shortly before the state of South Carolina awarder her the
Order of the Palmetto; the highest civilian honor.</p>
			<h3>Seneca Falls Convention</h3>
			<p>Held in Seneca Falls, New York from July 19 th to July 20 th , 1848, the Seneca
Falls Convention, Lead by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, was a
convention aimed to acquire basic civil rights for American women. Known for her
historical feminist work, Stanton presented to the attendees of the convention, the
Declaration of Sentiments. Modeled after the United States Declaration of
Independence, the Declaration of Sentiments provided a list of grievances and
demands women voiced. The Declaration of Sentiments was aimed to draw a
connection to the list of grievances and demands sent to the King of England in the
mid to late 1770’s. During the convention, the attendees passed eleven out of twelve
resolutions unanimously. The ninth resolution, regarding women’s suffrage, hit a
snag resulting in Stanton’s insisting on its passage. Although it faced ridicule and
almost failed to pass, the resolution became the basis for the 19 th amendment of the
United States Constitution in 1920.</p>
