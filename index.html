		<div class="introduction">
			<p>When I began researching and preparing to teach a senior capstone course on the principle of non-violence, it 
				became very clear that there was no one, single resource to capture the concepts of non-violence across different 
				fields of study. Unlike Professor Linder’s excellent resource for Famous Trials, there was no compendium online or 
				otherwise to which I could introduce my students. So, the challenge to my group of talented, multidisciplinary 
				University of New Hampshire Justice Studies Seniors was to either write a 25-page research paper OR write content 
				for a website dedicated to non-violence resources. They chose the website….. </p>

				<p>We began with the basic idea and principles of non-violence. Can ideas activated by people and movements dedicated 
					to resisting oppression be more powerful than weapons? The class was structured as a seminar course that took a 
					multidisciplinary approach to non-violence by drawing on insights and analysis from the fields of political science, 
					law, sports, international relations, criminal justice, psychology, literature, gender studies, economics, sociology, 
					anthropology, the fine arts and others. There were two class periods dedicated to each topic/unit, the first an interactive, 
					participatory discussion driven by both student interest, emerging trends in the field, and [for the most part] the gentle 
					“encouragement” of the course professor. The second class in each unit was a student presentation which not only formed the
					 foundation for their website contribution but was a student led interactive discussions of the issues, people and future 
					 application of the principles being examined.</p>
				
				<p>We all have some understanding of what violence is. Some forms of violence are easy to identify, such as war, battles, riots, 
					assault or rape. Some other forms of violence are not easy to identify because they are invidious, once hidden within the 
					fabric of our culture such as racism and sexism to identify two.</p>

				<p>What we have little understanding of is that which represents the concept of the “absence of violence.” As Mark Kurlansky wrote, 
				“The first clue, lesson number one from human history on the subject of nonviolence, is that there is no word for it. The concept has 
				been praised by every major religion. Throughout history there have been practitioners of nonviolence. Yet, every major language has a 
				word for violence, there is no word to express the idea of nonviolence except that it is not another idea, it is not violence.” 
				(Kurlansky, M. 2008) </p>

				<p>When asked, what are the greatest acts of violence in history? The answers are too numerous. When asked, what are the greatest 
					acts of nonviolence in history? Or, when asked, who are the greatest actors in the history of nonviolence only the familiar ring
					 of Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. resound. And, perhaps the most ironic question of all: what is the ironic objective of both
					  violence and nonviolence? Justice – by force; and justice – by understanding and love.</p>
				
				<p>The additional research conducted by students and their presentation content led to the website you are viewing today. This is 
					intended to be a “work in progress” and we invite your contributions and feedback.</p>
